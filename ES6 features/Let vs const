Like let, const is also blocked-scoped. The difference is that const cannot be reassigned once declared.

        const name = 'Zell'
        name = 'Sleepy head' // TypeError: Assignment to constant variable.

        let name1 = 'Zell'
        name1 = 'Sleepy head'
        console.log(name1) // 'Sleepy head'
        
Since const cannot be reassigned, theyâ€™re good for variables would not change.
