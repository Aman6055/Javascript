Destructuring arrays and destructuring objects are similar. We use square brackets ([]) instead of curly brackets ({}).

When you destructure an array,

Your first variable is the first item in the array.
Your second variable is the second item in the array.
and so onâ€¦
        let [one, two] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
        console.log(one) // 1
        console.log(two) // 2
        

When destructuring arrays, we often destructure only the variables we need. If you need the rest of the array, you can use the rest operator (...), like this:

let scores = ['98', '95', '93', '90', '87', '85']
let [first, second, third, ...rest] = scores

console.log(first) // 98
console.log(second) // 95
console.log(third) // 93
console.log(rest) // [90, 87, 85]
